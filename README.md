Magical Nathaniel is a twenty-year-old magician who currently lives in the Bay Area. He has been interested in magic since he was
three (17 years!). He saw World's Greatest Magic on TV for the first time and loved magic ever since. He got his first magic kit 
and preformed for his parents, then his relatives, and in third grade, he did his first full audience show. Soon he was 
performing for many classes around Madera Elementary. Later, he started volunteering for Playland-Not-at-the-Beach, giving weekly
shows for the volunteers. After two and a half years of volunteering, in June of 2008, Playland opened. Ever since, most weekends,
he has performed for thousands of patrons. That same summer, he also worked for the City of El Cerrito Summer camps doing shows 
and teaching classes. At the end of 2008, he started to attend El Cerrito High School and became the president of the Illusionist 
Club as well as won first place in both talent shows that year! In April of 2012, after the annual El Cerrito High Talent Show 
was dropped by the Senior class, he decided to put on a show of his own. In under a month, he wrote, directed, promoted, 
organized, produced, and starred in what was called the "Magical Variety Show", which was a huge success. In 2012, he also won 1st 
place in all 3 of the magic contests held by the Oakland Magic Circle, including the Inter-Club competition, against some of the 
best magicians in the Bay Area! He is currently attending UC Berkeley, is the head facilitator of the for-units Magic DeCal class
offered on campus, the President of the Magic Club, and is the past Historian of the Oakland Magic Circle. He plans to continue 
performing as much as he can.
